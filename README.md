# Student Accommodation and Lodging System (STALS) - Backend Server

An information system that allows users to search, get information, review, and report hotels, apartments, bed space, dormitories, and transient spaces in Los Banos.

## Tech Stack

MERN + Heroku as the remote host

## Backend Development Workflow

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` on the backend server directory
3. To run the server, run `node index.js`
4. To test the endpoints, run the server and go to a browser and type `http://localhost:3001/'endpoint-name'`
5. Preferably, use the Needle package for debugging. The request.js file will be delivered at a later date.
